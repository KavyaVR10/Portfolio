      <p className='ac'>I am an enthusiastic 3rd-year Computer Science and Engineering student,deeply passionate to solve problems.
        With solid foundation in core Computer Science subjects such as  Database Management Systems (DBMS), 
        Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Computer Networks (CN), and Operating Systems (OS), 
        I possess a well-rounded understanding of computer science principles.
        I have practical experience with web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
        and the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). My hands-on experience with tools like 
        Git and VS Code has empowered me to efficiently collaborate on projects and develop scalable solutions.
        I am driven by a passion for continuous learning, which motivates me to stay updated with the latest industry
         trends and incorporate new tools and technologies into my work.
         I have a natural inclination toward problem-solving, and I enjoy diving deep into challenging 
         coding problems and algorithms. This mindset has driven me to participate in coding competitions
         , where Iâ€™ve gained valuable experience working under pressure, collaborating with teams, and 
         presenting solutions clearly and effectively.
         I am a strong believer in the importance of continuous learning and actively 
         seek opportunities to develop my skill set
         I am eager to further develop my expertise and contribute meaningfully to impactful projects,
          aiming to make a positive difference in the technology field.</p>
